    function drawCardMin(c)
        create a jQuery div
        set the text to c.text
        style it so it is 1-line tall (regardless of newlines in c.text)
        style it so it has no scrollbars, even if it is too small to fit the text
        put a 1 pixel solid black border on it
        return the jQuery div

- in drawWindow
