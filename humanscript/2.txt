- fork https://github.com/dglittle/PIMA
- note: to see it run:
    - type: python main.py 12345
    - then go to: localhost:12345/index2.html

- put these instructions in a new file in the "humanscript" directory

- open "index2.html"

- here is a sketch of what I want it to look like (but make it work):

function drawWindow(w) {
    do stuff to create dialog window with a textbox in it
    position the dialog at w.x, w.y, and use w.w and w.h for width and height
    put w.query as text into the textbox
}

$(function(){
    var d = generateSampleData();
    for w in d.windows:
        drawWindow(w)
});

function generateSampleData () {
    same as before
}

- test it
    - run it
    - take screenshot (should have two windows positioned with data in data.windows from generateSampleData function)
    - put screenshot in "humanscript/output"

- push everything to github
- make pull request to original repository
